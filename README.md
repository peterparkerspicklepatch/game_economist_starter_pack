# Welcome!
I’ve collected a wide variety of material and links in this pack. It covers a wide diversity of topics, not limited to game design but covering other critical functions like production and development.
Diving into the material and embracing the adventure of game-making is vital to increasing the odds of success.
The materials below are organized into discipline and have a short summary underneath the links. The materials are stack ranked in terms of “importance” within each category.
# Materials
## Macro Industry Understanding
### [Freemium Economics: Leveraging Analytics and User Segmentation to Drive Revenue](https://read.amazon.com/kp/embed?asin=B00HNVG0MG&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_EN5V1DCP7QNTJYFFYSAQ)
The book is the best intro into modern F2P with lots of web3 cross-over. It provides an excellent survey on the model and metrics commonly used in games. The author, Eric Seufert, is a master of mobile user acquisition and has been for the better part of a decade. He runs a high-quality blog that dives into modern user acquisition problems. This is linked later in the pack.
### 7 Reasons Why Video Gaming Will Take Over
A quintessential pre-“Metaverse” Matthew Ball essay that’s good to read in companion with the above. In the essay, Matthew describes the difference between games and other forms of media.
### [One Up: Creativity, Competition, and the Global Business of Video Games](https://read.amazon.com/kp/embed?asin=B087NC6LS8&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_SH2EDSM21X89QKG7SWN5)
The book takes a long time horizon and is more academic than anything listed. The book marshals a lot of pre-2000 data about how the game industry was changing. The author, Joost Van Dreunen, used to run SuperData, which sourced a great deal of industry-level data.
## Production
### [Postmortems: Selects Essays](https://read.amazon.com/kp/embed?asin=B07DKWGK4B&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_MC0NEPF5A10A5SJXDFNQ)
A heavy read at ~600 pages but covers many issues, from art production to engine problems. The challenge with postmortems isn’t if they are accurate depictions of what went wrong but rather how applicable their problems are to your problems. All in all, adopting these lessons improves your batting average even if some of claims are strikes.
### Postmortem: Irrational Games’ System Shock 2
I cheated by including another postmortem, but this one is short and sweet. It’s dated  1990 but is a good reference for how the team overcame many challenges to deliver. The takeaway is how tech choices reverberate throughout a project.
### [How Do You Make a Game That Was Supposed to Be Small, but Ended up Being Huge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcxRUc092WY&ab_channel=GDC)
Not the greatest talk, but it’s a good reflection of tests or “gates” a developer should make at each stage of production before moving on to the next. Takeaways are production phases and the challenges of scaling over time.
### [Production: Working at the Heart of the Team](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9-ZI1j4a6A&ab_channel=GDC)
Self-recommending. An extremely practical GDC talk captures many challenges of group decision-making on a single creative product. Feel free to stop watching after 38:00 - the last speaker is not worth the time.
## Design
### [Freemium Mobile Games: Design & Monetization](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1512322172/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_D8WE5TEWN7KPSEBY6Q1R)
A savvy guide to the design choices that separate F2P and live-service from traditional HD (i.e., PC/Console games). There’s some overlap with Suefert's book, but this one is more design then metrics focused.
### [Rules of the Game: Another Five Techniques from Particularly Crafty Designers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVq1-y7ailE&ab_channel=GDC)
It’s good because it’s game design tapas with actionable advice. I would suggest following through on the talk’s challenge:
“For each rule, you can then decide whether it’s useful for your own projects and how you might merge that technique into your own design rulebook. You may not agree with every rule you hear in this fast-paced and energetic session, but they’ll certainly get you thinking about the craft of game design.”
### [Practical Creativity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyVTxGpEO30&ab_channel=GDC)
This is one of Raph’s (Ultima Online and now doing web3) best talks. It’s relevant for StrongBlock in that Raph strips down mechanics and tracks how they apply to different genres. We’ll be doing a lot of this!
### Royal Match - The New King from Turkey
I referenced this game in the pitch deck because it’s a beautiful story of what rigorous study and sweat can do. Despite being out-resourced and out-spent, the developer successfully grabbed market share from the billion-dollar match-3 titans.
This deconstruction showcases two things: (1) it exemplifies an excellent deconstruction, and (2) it highlights crucial decisions in match-3. It’s a great “behind the scenes” look at how a simple genre requires deep thought.
## UX
### [Juice it or Lose It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy0aCDmgnxg&ab_channel=grapefrukt)
Animation is probably one of the most significant differences between polish and unpolished games. The talk is lightning quick and demonstrates how small touches’ have an incredible effect on the product. Do not wait until the last sprint before release to start concepting these!
# Sites to follow
- [Deconstructor of Fun](https://www.deconstructoroffun.com/)
Great teardowns by a variety of designers. The podcast is good, but the weekly release may be hard to get into. They do one-offs which may be more valuable.

This is me!
- [Naavik](https://naavik.co/themetacast)
The host is completely unexciting, but if you can survive the experience, there are good web3 conversations as well as web2 ones. Their newsletter is wonderful to boot, and I know many consultants who work there -  they are the real deal.
- [Game Makers](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJNjY2wtI5-F9ECeSA9KhEQ)
The interview can veer into inside baseball, but they cover various topics, from hiring outsources to design teardowns.
